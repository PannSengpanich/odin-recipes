    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Shrimp fried rice</strong>
      is a popular dish with a delicious, rounded and fragrant taste. The sweet
      shrimp and rice complement each other and are served with cucumber, lime,
      and fish sauce chili to enhance the flavor. Our secret is to cook the rice
      perfectly, then let it cool before stir-frying it with fresh shrimp and
      seasoning until well combined, resulting in a delicious and flavorful
      shrimp fried rice.
