    </p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cups milk</li>
      <li>½ cup condensed milk, (sub with glucose or corn syrup)</li>
      <li>
        your choice of toppings (e.g. chopped fruit, red bean, condensed milk,
        candy, etc.)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a freezer-safe container, mix the milk and condensed milk together
        using a whisk.
      </li>
      <li>Cover the mixture and freeze for at least 5 hours or overnight.</li>
      <li>
        While the mixture is freezing, prepare your toppings. You can chop up
        some fruits like mangoes, strawberries, kiwi or bananas. Set them aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the mixture has frozen, remove it from the container and wrap it
        in some plastic wrap. This will make it easier to hold.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hold the wrapped up milk block with a towel to protect your skin and
        begin shaving it into a bowl using a grater. You can also use a food
        processor with a grater attachment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add your favourite toppings and drizzle some condensed milk on top.
        Enjoy!
