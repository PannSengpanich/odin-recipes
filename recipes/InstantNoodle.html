    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Instant Noodle</strong>
      is a type of food consisting of noodles sold in a precooked and dried
      block with flavoring powder and/or seasoning oil. The dried noodle block
      was originally created by flash frying cooked noodles, and this is still
      the main method used in Asian countries; air-dried noodle blocks are
      favored in Western countries. Dried noodle blocks are designed to be
      cooked or soaked in boiling water before eating. Ramen, a Japanese
      adaptation of Chinese noodle soup, is sometimes used as a descriptor for
      instant noodle flavors by some Japanese manufacturers. It has become
      synonymous in the United States for all instant noodle products.
